## GAN demo using tensorflow and Keras.
### GAN to create a generator that would generate new images that are 
  similar to images of mnist digits 

  Most of the source code was borrowed from the blog at [Beginner's guide to GANs](https://skymind.ai/wiki/generative-adversarial-network-gan)

### To run
#### Notebook 
* GAN.ipynb is a python notebook with all the code. I have tried the code in jupyter notebook and on google colab, using python3
#### Pre-requisites 
* Create a folder corresponding to root\_folder as defined in the code. Default code mounts google drives and creates files there, but you can chagne it to use your local filesystem.
* Create a folder corresponding to root\_folder+"/gan/images/"
* Install any python packages needed either from a terminal, or from within the notebook as eg. **__pip3 install --user numpy__**

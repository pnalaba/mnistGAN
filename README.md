  Most of the source code was borrowed from the blog at [Beginner's guide to GANs](https://skymind.ai/wiki/generative-adversarial-network-gan)

### To run
#### Pre-requisites 
###### Create a folder corresponding to root\_folder as defined in the code. Default code mounts google drives and creates files there, but you can chagne it to use your local filesystem.
